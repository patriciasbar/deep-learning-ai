"My son said they are really good",5
"I had bought these to go along with my earbuds so did't want anything to expensive
But, the sound was decent, albeit after tweaking with the app. Nice and comfortable, quickly paired with my phone and app. Although the buttons can be hard to feel out sometimes.",5

"These are great quality headphones for the money. I got them on sale as well for nearly 50% off so they were a real bargain for that price. My friend has some expensive ones of these and yes they are better but for how much they cost they are not that much better.

I have purchased these for the gym, and they are ideal for that! Recommended.",5
"Very good quality and good cushioning",5
"Good product....volume could be slightly higher but overall brilliant product.

"I didn't know what to expect for £35....but wow I am impressed!! I have had Galaxy Bud Pro's for a while now, and they are pretty awesome....but....when I'm in the gym my right earbud falls out all the time during big lifts!! So I decided to get some over the headphones instead.

I didn't want to pay a lot as they are only for use in the gym really, and noise cancelling wasn't a requirement. To be honest, the noise cancelling on my Galaxy Bud Pro's actually makes me a bit dizzy and disoriented!! So anyway, I had a little look around and found these. The reviews seemed very positive so for £35 they were worth a shot. Well, I am very impressed with these headphones! After comparing them to muly Galaxy Bud Pro's and can say that there is very little difference in sound quality! The only advantage with the buds is a slightly more immersive sound....but only slightly!

For £35 you absolutely cannot go wrong with these. They are comfortable and secure without putting too much pressure on the ears,and they sound great! The JBL app is also great fun r tweaking your sound preferences. The bass on these is really nice, and I could also hear lots of melody's in the music I listen to (mostly metal, Unleash the Archers, FFDP etc) that I hadn't noticed before!",5
"My nephew loved it!",5
"I love these headphones and they were definitely worth the money. It’s light and easy to carry around and it doesn’t die quickly. I love them definitely recommend

"Im wearing it rigth now and im loving it",5
"Came broken",1
"Stopped working after a month
",1
"Not happy wrote on here ages ago saying these head phones don't work can't send them bk as sent them to other country as present stopped working need my money bk",1
"Good sound, however as I’ve hit my 6th week they don’t fit my head well and very loose. Had it been with a month d of returned! Shame
",1
"Absolutely the poorest quality. Do not buy",1
These are probably the worst pair of headphones I've ever owned....certainly the most uncomfortable. The headband is far too tight and that is for someone with a small head. Forget wearing them all day. Save your money and buy something decent.,1
"I dropped it as soon as I got the foam cover and there's no way to put it on. terrible
",1
"I opened the product I was hooked and disappointed. There is no sound from the right earphone. I'll return it.",1
"The headset I received was used (dirty) and broken. Highly dissapointed.",1
"I received the headset the first week of May and charged it as soon as it was delivered, but the right earphone did not work. I created a return request about three weeks later and returned it to the seller. The seller reached me as soon as I received the delivery, they said that we will send the headset to the service because you did not return the product in the first 3 days. My headset has not been contacted by anyone in service for about four weeks. I have no idea in what case. I have spoken with amazon customer service regarding the matter and I am told you will be back within 72 hours it has been a while since I have still not received a return I am waiting for a return from someone in charge.",1
I bought the product for a few days I used it but I never got used to the pads it hurts until you fry your ears don't get it the ear pads are very poor quality inside the ears better you don't know where to put it in your horse pocket it's tiny,1
"Do not worry, the fake comes in 1 year it breaks down on its own
",1
I bought it to listen to music on the phone. The volume is a complete disappointment. No need to give this money. It is no different from the 300 - 500 TL products on the market.,1
"The power button does not work and it seems to be a manufacturing defect",1
"What a let down by JBL!
Had to put up a return request within 30 minutes of receiving the earphone. It is really that bad. Perhaps okay for pre-teen/teen age group but not suitable for an adult ear. The call quality is unacceptable for office work (TEAMS/ZOOM calls).",1
"It is not comfortable and the sponge is so hard that my ears became red. Someone gave me a palm and the sound was on it for you to be safe",1
"It has been recalled. Thank you Amazon
",1
"Impossible to charge it while the previous one, purchased at Fnac, poses no problem.",1
"It’s fake and almost every few hours the sound gets muted but it says it’s connected? So every time I have to put “forget the device” and repair it again EVERY TIME, not worth it
",1
"The battery lasts too short. My daughter uses the headphones and is frustrated after a certain period of time because the battery is empty again...
",1
"I am very upset, since we bought the headphones as a gift from kings because of their great battery life. They worked very well until a few days ago, when it started to disconnect suddenly while the person was on a phone call. Yesterday they turned off and did not charge anything, the battery percentage is fixed at 36%.",1
"The wrap has a long service life, yes, but it is not suitable for use for a long time. It was broken in five months before it was even a year old. It does not show the performance expected of a product given and received that much money. Their sponges are constantly coming out, their expansion is a separate problem. It becomes abundant in your head after a while.",1
"I didn't like the fact that you can't hear the TV and the headphones at the same time",1
"It turnes off completely I will have to reconnect and turn it on every few minutes !!!!!!
Terrible",1
The product is quite bad in sound quality than the previous JBL Tune 510BT Model. The single charge is very good. But those who want superior sound quality should NOT get the 520BT!!,1
