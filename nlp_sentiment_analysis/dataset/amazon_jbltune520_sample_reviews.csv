Excellent buy. Easy to charge and sync. Comfy over the ears and not huge - perfect for a smaller adult head and nice slim profile. Lovely bass sound . Thoroughly recommend,5
Comfortable easy to pair with devices good sound and good price,5
"The product is very cool and I really liked it considering the price, it is not the best product but for the price it is very good. It works very well and is very easy to link to any device.",5
"Great sound and easy to connect to my iPhones Bluetooth. App is easy to use too.
Comfortable and lightweight",5
"Very good product for kids, for my ears, is little bit small speakers. But JBL always have good sound.",5
"Fantastic sound quality. Able to mix your own sounds for whatever music you prefer to listen to. Really lightweight and comfy. Highly recommend",5
"My son said they are really good",5
"I had bought these to go along with my earbuds so did't want anything to expensive
But, the sound was decent, albeit after tweaking with the app. Nice and comfortable, quickly paired with my phone and app. Although the buttons can be hard to feel out sometimes.",5
"You'll be surprised at the sound. Easy to connect to bluetooth
",5
"Good, does the job . Little loose when bend down
",5
"These work great comfy to use",5
"These are great quality headphones for the money. I got them on sale as well for nearly 50% off so they were a real bargain for that price. My friend has some expensive ones of these and yes they are better but for how much they cost they are not that much better.

I have purchased these for the gym, and they are ideal for that! Recommended.",5
"Very good quality and good cushioning",5
"Good product....volume could be slightly higher but overall brilliant product.
",5
"Great sound and excellent price",5
Great head phones for the price just as good as probably better that apple air pods which I'm sick of replacing after kids loose one sound quality just the same as the expensive ones if not better,5
"amazing quality
",5
"Bought as a gift
",5
"Bought for my son for running for great and sound quality is fab",5
"Base is amazing sound Quality amazing, comfort, battery life hood, easy to work",5
"I didn't know what to expect for £35....but wow I am impressed!! I have had Galaxy Bud Pro's for a while now, and they are pretty awesome....but....when I'm in the gym my right earbud falls out all the time during big lifts!! So I decided to get some over the headphones instead.

I didn't want to pay a lot as they are only for use in the gym really, and noise cancelling wasn't a requirement. To be honest, the noise cancelling on my Galaxy Bud Pro's actually makes me a bit dizzy and disoriented!! So anyway, I had a little look around and found these. The reviews seemed very positive so for £35 they were worth a shot. Well, I am very impressed with these headphones! After comparing them to muly Galaxy Bud Pro's and can say that there is very little difference in sound quality! The only advantage with the buds is a slightly more immersive sound....but only slightly!

For £35 you absolutely cannot go wrong with these. They are comfortable and secure without putting too much pressure on the ears,and they sound great! The JBL app is also great fun r tweaking your sound preferences. The bass on these is really nice, and I could also hear lots of melody's in the music I listen to (mostly metal, Unleash the Archers, FFDP etc) that I hadn't noticed before!",5
"My nephew loved it!",5
"I love these headphones and they were definitely worth the money. It’s light and easy to carry around and it doesn’t die quickly. I love them definitely recommend
",5
"Im wearing it rigth now and im loving it",5
"Came broken",1
"Stopped working after a month
",1
"Not happy wrote on here ages ago saying these head phones don't work can't send them bk as sent them to other country as present stopped working need my money bk",1
"Good sound, however as I’ve hit my 6th week they don’t fit my head well and very loose. Had it been with a month d of returned! Shame
",1
"Absolutely the poorest quality. Do not buy",1
These are probably the worst pair of headphones I've ever owned....certainly the most uncomfortable. The headband is far too tight and that is for someone with a small head. Forget wearing them all day. Save your money and buy something decent.,1
"I dropped it as soon as I got the foam cover and there's no way to put it on. terrible
",1
"I opened the product I was hooked and disappointed. There is no sound from the right earphone. I'll return it.",1
"The headset I received was used (dirty) and broken. Highly dissapointed.",1
"I received the headset the first week of May and charged it as soon as it was delivered, but the right earphone did not work. I created a return request about three weeks later and returned it to the seller. The seller reached me as soon as I received the delivery, they said that we will send the headset to the service because you did not return the product in the first 3 days. My headset has not been contacted by anyone in service for about four weeks. I have no idea in what case. I have spoken with amazon customer service regarding the matter and I am told you will be back within 72 hours it has been a while since I have still not received a return I am waiting for a return from someone in charge.",1
I bought the product for a few days I used it but I never got used to the pads it hurts until you fry your ears don't get it the ear pads are very poor quality inside the ears better you don't know where to put it in your horse pocket it's tiny,1
"Do not worry, the fake comes in 1 year it breaks down on its own
",1
I bought it to listen to music on the phone. The volume is a complete disappointment. No need to give this money. It is no different from the 300 - 500 TL products on the market.,1
"The power button does not work and it seems to be a manufacturing defect",1
"What a let down by JBL!
Had to put up a return request within 30 minutes of receiving the earphone. It is really that bad. Perhaps okay for pre-teen/teen age group but not suitable for an adult ear. The call quality is unacceptable for office work (TEAMS/ZOOM calls).",1
"It is not comfortable and the sponge is so hard that my ears became red. Someone gave me a palm and the sound was on it for you to be safe",1
"It has been recalled. Thank you Amazon
",1
"Impossible to charge it while the previous one, purchased at Fnac, poses no problem.",1
"It’s fake and almost every few hours the sound gets muted but it says it’s connected? So every time I have to put “forget the device” and repair it again EVERY TIME, not worth it
",1
"The battery lasts too short. My daughter uses the headphones and is frustrated after a certain period of time because the battery is empty again...
",1
"I am very upset, since we bought the headphones as a gift from kings because of their great battery life. They worked very well until a few days ago, when it started to disconnect suddenly while the person was on a phone call. Yesterday they turned off and did not charge anything, the battery percentage is fixed at 36%.",1
"The wrap has a long service life, yes, but it is not suitable for use for a long time. It was broken in five months before it was even a year old. It does not show the performance expected of a product given and received that much money. Their sponges are constantly coming out, their expansion is a separate problem. It becomes abundant in your head after a while.",1
"I didn't like the fact that you can't hear the TV and the headphones at the same time",1
"It turnes off completely I will have to reconnect and turn it on every few minutes !!!!!!
Terrible",1
The product is quite bad in sound quality than the previous JBL Tune 510BT Model. The single charge is very good. But those who want superior sound quality should NOT get the 520BT!!,1
"Great sound deep sounding bass,
Long lasting between charges and charges fast, compacts down folding up, would definitely recommend especially for the price",5
"Long battery, good sound quality, good for the gym. I’ve been buying jbl headphones for a few years for the gym and never had any problems with sweat getting into them and affecting the sound, also don’t smell at all after daily use in the gym",5
"Have had several headsets over the years but thought I would try a Bluetooth over ears set as ear buds do not suit me.
JOB have a good reputation and that's why I chose these , plus they were in offer.
They are comfortable to wear with very good cushions to assist with noise cancelling . Sound quality is exceptional for the price .d
I even like the usb charging so no need to carry a plug .",5
Nothing wrong with the performance level. Too hot for summer for sure.,5
Wasn’t expecting much but these headphones are brilliant having trouble getting the voice control but my fault as I’ve not downloaded the Google voice app I am very pleased with the headphones & you can set your hearing preferences in the JBL app yes I would recommend them the bass is brilliant,5
"My grandson lov d them",5
"I bought a pair of these and couldn’t believe how good they are, battery life is insane!! I bought myself and my step son a pair after I tried them out honestly unreal quality, top purchase for next to nothing!",5
"Slim, comfortable even after hours of use.
The battery lasts a very long time and with the downloaded app let's you choose preset sound profiles or even create your own.
Connects straight away with and paired device easily.
Charging time is a couple of hours.
The only slightly negative is the lenght of the charging cable but as it's a common usb-c plug was not a problem as I had dozens anyway",5
"The price is definitely worth it, good sound and you can download the app to change the sound to fit you best. Comfortable, loud with good bass and cancels most outside noise.",5
Easy to connect to devices. Volume required on device is set much lower then old earbuds I was using and the quality is much better. Would recommend them as a reasonably priced set of headphones.,5
"Very good headphones, very comfortable and very good bass.",5
t’s a dream 🥶 battery life is on another level ..Value for money 💯,5
"Very great.

Customer service quality product and very useful. Arrive time delivery quality is excellent.",5
"I use these in the gym and they are great. Good bass and sound quality, not too big and feel comfy.",5
Wonderful JBL,5
"for cheap headphones good quality , quick connection to my laptop , comfy to wear",5
"High recommended, comfortable, good battery and good quality sound",5
These headphones pack a real punch! Excellent value for money with fantastic sound quality! Comfortable to wear and there is an app you can download to enhance the use of these headphones. Really pleased with how easy they were to use too and to set up. Would definitely recommend!,5
For the money these are top quality,5
So must be good,5
"Good volume, great for the gym all around great headphones for the price",5
Good product for the price.,5
Very nice product. Have been enjoying it since I bought it. Great value for m,5
"Excellent sound quality, needed update once connected but didn't take long so really impressed with them. Recommended.",5
"Great little headphones, sturdy and lightweight",5
"fast connect
multiple device connection
battery is veeeeery good",5
product all good just what i wanted,5
good,5
"I'm convinced these headphones are made from depleted uranium or some sort of bullet-proof metal. You charge these once for 2 hours and they last you like a month. Not to mention these bad boys take a fair beating, dropped it a couple times and it still remains intact.",5
"Usually for the small shaped heads. Anyone with the bigger head shape might find them uncomfortable.
Sound quality and bluetooth pairing is good.",5
"I bought these from Hughes.
They fit well and are comfortable.
The sound quality is really good.
I wore them all around my 2 bedroom flat and not once did I lose connection, and it's a big flat...if you download the app you can set them up to answer phone calls and pause stuff,so I think they are amazing for the price.
I would definitely recommend.
I'm really crappie with electronic stuff but once you connect they stay connected even when turning on and off which saves time..love them.",5
I am currently loving this and I got it the next after I ordered for it. 👌,5
"I bought this headset in may 2023 and since then it has been in a great shape and condition. It’s comfortable and easy to fold and fit. Sound quality is great with a very good noise cancellation.
Battery life stays for a long time and you can connect it with two different devices at a time.",5
Would be amazing if everyone else couldn’t hear what I’m listening too you may aswell play your music out loud on your phone because everyone around you can hear it,2
"Unfortunately, the headphones look a bit poorly made despite the high price, you probably pay mainly for the brand name. The sound quality is mediocre, especially when it comes to the bass.
After only about half an hour of wear, the product presses on the auricles and on the top of the head. I've never experienced anything like this before, I wear a cable headset connected to the PC for at least 2 hours every day, which was much cheaper.
The advantages are the easy accessibility and function of the buttons, the software available free of charge for setting the sound and the great connectivity, which is never interrupted despite sometimes being far away from the Bluetooth device. However, the headphones came back again due to the unfortunately many disadvantages.",2
"For the sound it's average ok, it doesn't break bricks but for movies or shows it works, for music I have Hifiman and Focal much better sound qualities, but where I am very very disappointed is that it slammed after 6 months of use, never fell, always used at home in short, junk...",2
"It's not an expensive headphone but it's not super cheap either. I had headphones with a 'jack' that for much less euros offered a much more immersive and clean audio experience. I don't want to return it out of laziness but if I went back I wouldn't buy them back. The design is there, they are practical, comfortable, but the sound left me a bit disappointed, it's not powerful, it's not very clean. JBL is a very overrated brand. Those who say they are great headphones have never owned decent headphones.",2
"I have been using 500bt since 2018. I bought the pads instead of replacing them when they were jeans, but I didn't wear them. In this model with a decimal place, the light does not burn, it only burns in the immediate and closed. You can't tell if the link issue is open or closed when it's legal. In an emergency, there is a female voice, not a warning sound, which says, “power on, power off, pairing.” I don't understand the headphone technology, but I can understand that the sound sounds rich sbsbh I don't think the sound sounds clean. Also, while the 500bt model does not hurt my ear at all, after a year on this model, unfortunately my ear hurts. I didn't want to bother with a new purchase because I'm going to move out of the country, but it's unlikely that we will not be together with this model for a long time.",2
"The headphones performed well for around 3 weeks.
The sound is very good, the outside noises are well shielded and the app allows you to adjust a few more settings.

I bought the headphones for weight training and deliberately didn't want to buy anything too expensive. However, I would not have expected that these headphones would only last about 3 weeks.

The headphones slipped off my head during push-ups and fell on the floor from a very low height.. the button with the + (volume button) was stuck and couldn't be pressed anymore.

Now the volume is permanently at maximum and the headphones continue to play a song on their own, turn off and on uncontrollably and are therefore no longer usable.

Well, I had hoped for more, too bad about 42 euros",2
"In my opinion, too big and not a good fit.",2
"I actually have a relatively large head, but the bracket is still extremely sticking. I think it looks even less in the photo than it actually does.
Sound and bass didn't really convince me now either",2
"There was no Aux cable or the option for the Aux.
",2
"There was a small damage to the pad when the product first reached me, opening when tensioned when installing on the side parts of the upper beams of the product. A product that does not give confidence in the long run. It began to loosen after 1 week of use. Sound quality is good, except for the exterior material, so I give it 2 points.I hope they accept returns.",2
"Someone else bought them and the headphones were small, I kept them myself but he's right the headphones were a little tight and we didn't like the fit of the headphones either. If I lower my head a little they fall and on the contrary too.",2
"I don't know if it's because of the characteristics of jbl, but it's half the sound difference from the crappy headphones I bought for 200 pounds years ago, of course it sounds good, but I don't really like it, especially if you have long hair and a big head, which I'm not. Headphones are like children's headphones",2
I used to use Anker space but I wanted to give it a chance. I returned it because I found the build (ok di) rather than the headset to be of poor quality.,2
"I bought it with great enthusiasm, but it didn't turn out as I expected. The sound quality of the JBL, as we know, is not a problem with it, but due to its structure it put a lot of pressure on my ears, and in general it put pressure on my head and bothered me. He made his slicons excessively sweaty even on a winter day. There are a lot of people who have used this or that similar series and are satisfied, but unfortunately I was not satisfied. My advice is to look at the 720bt model, etc., if you want an earpiece.",2
I have heard that both the volume and bass level are very low the bt570 is better but I bought it just for the 57 hours of use time I wish I didn't buy it doesn't cost too bad bt570 or a different brand can be preferred Do not buy this product,2
"On my first order, both the box and the headphones came out of order. I thought a bit about placing the second order I bought it from a different seller or am I the size this time like there is nothing in the product but the box arrived damaged. I am personally disgusted by these situations",2
"See quality is good but when you can't listen the connection keeps getting disconnected, I will return it.",2
You press the ear in an annoying and painful way,2
I have requested a change that the volume up and call acceptance key is broken,2
"The delivery time of the product is very good as f/p is also fast, but the shipping company they work with says that if you are far from the city center, the cargo company cannot bring the product and you have to go and pick it up, and you need to follow this up.",2
"Don't take it, even if the voice is too low, it sounds disappointing",2
"They do not fulfill their function: very low sound quality; scant sound volume, making it impossible to perceive the quality of the compositions; distorting treble; bass without depth. The only valid thing is its size: transportable for travel.",1
I have been using it for two months and the sound seems to drop in a strange way and I can't return it because the return period has expired 😔,1
It is not appropriate for those who wear the hearing aid for an hour or more because the hearing aid is on the ears and it feels painful after removing it,1
The right earlobe of the product was displaced within a week.,1
"Two days with them and almost all of the pad has come off, apart from the fact that at no time did I find the cable for fatal charging",1
The sound is very weak compared to Sony speakers. The difference in sound power is almost doubled!!!,1
Sound goes out very loudly from the headphones like Haporlöl,1
"The ear sponge is small and painful. In addition, the ears are not peripheral",1
The charge runs out quickly and becomes very fast,1
It works for 20 minutes and is suddenly disconnected,1
"It does not match what was announced. They are advertised to reduce noise and it's not true, this model doesn't.",1
Headphones are very good but sound more than right I would like to contact the seller,1
